Theorem-like markup

Usage
-----

{{Postulate 3}} ...

{{Theorem 8}} ...

- Which words can be used for Postulate, Theorem, ... shall be defined
in /en/theorem-like.erb, /fr/theorem-like.erb, etc;
- This will not only lay them out with a consistent typography but it will
also define links so that one can later refer to [Theorem 8]
and [Postulate 3] in our example.

The following Rules shall be enabled

   filter :bacchantes
   filter :erb
%>
<%=
id = "#{@kind}-#{@number}"
text = "#{@kind.capitalize} #{@number}"
"[#{text}]:##{id}\n**#{text}.**{:##{id}}"
%>
